# input java code:
public class Oddity {
    public static boolean isOdd(int i) { return i % 2 == 1;
}
}

# This function is created to check if the number is odd. It seems to me that the current logic is right.
# Bot I would like to correct the style of this code, my version:

public class Oddity {
    public static boolean isOdd(int i) {
        return i % 2 == 1;
    }
}
